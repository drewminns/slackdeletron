## What the?

Slack Deletron is a service that helps users of Slack manage files and storage on their workspaces. The site is a UI wrapper over the [Slack API Web Methods](https://api.slack.com/methods) available to all users.

I do not work for Slack (although I would 😘 - Call me: [drewminns.com](http://drewminns.com) ) , so this is purely a fun side project to help out the community.

The API has it's limits so this project tries to work it's best within them, but of course, not all features are possible.

**Mostly, I wanted to build this to help others learn and contribute to the project**

## Whoa, V2 had a bulk delete button!! Where'd that go bro?!

So Yes, you used to be able to bulk delete files in older versions. However, Slack has applied [rate limits](https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits) to it's API to limit concurrent requests to their server. Totally fair, the old versions of this app would hammer them. You see, the only way to delete a file is to send off a request with the file ID. To do bulk deletion, the app would make a large number of individual requests to the endpoint for each file ID, which could lead to other async issues aside.

Instead of setting up a queueing system to manage bulk deletion requests, handling different services and servers, and creating a notification system; I decided to put the focus on managing the files and **finally** addressing the features that people tweet, email and leave in the Github issues.

## Running Locally

### Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

1.  Clone the Repo locally

`git clone git@github.com:drewminns/slackdeletron.git`

2.  Install the dependencies

`npm i`

3.  Create a new Slack App for local development at [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps). You'll need to give it a name and assign to a Slack Workspace. In the App Credentials section, grab the Client ID and the Client Secret values.

4. Configure the oAuth Permissions that the app will need, by clicking on 'Add features and functionality' -> 'Permissions' button. In that section, add the callback url to your local running instance `http://localhost:8081/api/slack/callback`.

5. Below the Callback URL, configure the scopes that your app will need.
  - channels:read
  - groups:read
  - files:read
  - files:write:user
  - users:read

6.  Create a `dev.js` file in the `config/keys` directory to hold your local configuration.

```
module.exports = {
  slackClientID: <Client ID>,
  slackClientSecret: <Client Secret>,
  cookieKey: <Random string>,
}
```

5.  Run the app

`npm run dev`

## Contribution

I'm thrilled that you want to add a feature, fix a bug or improve the code! Pull the code down, create a feature branch and get to it.

You can find some issues [here](https://github.com/drewminns/slackdeletron/issues) that need love!

All branches are run through CI for testing and require myself to merge it in!

## FAQ

**How does this work?**

This app uses the [Slack Web API Methods](https://api.slack.com/methods) that are open to all users. You define the type of files you want to search for, this app helps you navigate them, and the API handles the deletion.

**Is this made by Slack?**

Nope, but I would LOVE to work for Slack ;).

**Is this thing safe?**

I store nothing. The only information needed to log you in is stored in your browser as a cookie and a service work. There are no databases, no caching (except on your own machine), anything.
